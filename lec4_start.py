   Spring 2026
   Starter code for class on 1/14/26

   This is roughly the same as the code we finished with on Monday 1/12, except...
   * Dictionaries instead of lists are everywhere (gather_mileage_input, and 
    generate_mileage_stats)
    * A new function just prints out the summary for a given runner.

    On Wednesday 1/14, we want to add to generate_mileage_stats:
    * in case of an empty dictionary or None, return None
    * in case of negative miles, raise an error
