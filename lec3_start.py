   Starter code from class -- 1/12/26

    This program prompts the user for the daily mileage of two runners and compares them.

    In this starter version, we use lists to maintain and analyze the runners' data:
    * List 1 -- dates we're tracking
    * List 2 -- Laney's mileage
    * List 3 -- Nate's mileage

    The lists are all the same length and the values at a given index correspond with each other. 
    For example, if the lists contain...
        dates = ["JAN 06", "JAN 07"]
        laney_mileage = [4, 5]
        nate_mileage = [0, 8]
    ... then, we know that on January 6th, Laney ran 4 miles and Nate ran 0 miles.

    In class, we'll see how dictionaries can be a different (better??) way to organize this data.

       Parameters:
