# cs2100-scratch
Just some code for cs2100 Spring 2026, Laney's sections, to practice with github

In your VSCode terminal, do once:
  git clone git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/cs2100-scratch.git

And then after any change has been made in the main branch, I might ask you to update, and in that case you'd go to your repo and type:
  git pull
