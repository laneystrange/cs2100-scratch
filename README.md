# cs2100-scratch
Just some code for cs2100 Spring 2026, Laney's sections, to practice with github

## Once you have created a github account, do this:
* In your browser, go to the CS2100-scratch repo, https://github.com/laneystrange/cs2100-scratch
* Click on "code", select SSH tab, and "copy"
* In VSCode, type "git clone" and then paste

And then after any change has been made in the main branch, I might ask you to update your locla repo, and in that case you'd navigate to this repo in your VSCode terminal and type:
* git pull
