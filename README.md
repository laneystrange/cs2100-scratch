# cs2100-scratch
Just some code for cs2100 Spring 2026, Laney's sections, to practice with github

In your VSCode terminal, do once:
  click on "code" and select SSH tab, hit copy
  git clone [paste]

And then after any change has been made in the main branch, I might ask you to update your locla repo, and in that case you'd navigate to this repo in your VSCode terminal and type:
  git pull
